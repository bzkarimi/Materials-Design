# Non-Arrhenius Behavior and Dynamic Fluxionality

The code automatically searches all the combinations of activation energies for an ensemble of 5 isomers to find the ones 
with non-Arrhenius behavior based on their R<sup>2</sup> value. The code can be easily edited to work for other ensembles as well.
